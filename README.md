## General info
In this project it is possible to register a user account that makes a default bank account with EUR currency. Make different accounts with different currencies. Transfer money between accounts with currency conversion if needed. With the accounts you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies or short-sell them. Also bought cryptocurrencies can be transfered to a different account. You can follow all your money and cryptocurrency transactions in the history.

This project uses API keys from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) for cryptocurrencies, [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) for balance conversions
